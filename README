DESCRIPTION
===========

ddns-updater.sh is just a bash script aimimg at preforming those tedious dynamic dns updates on your behalf.
It should depend only on the existence of basic commands and help you prevent having to download a bunch of dependencies just to preform such a task. In fact it should run even with dash... but I can't guarantee that.
It should work with a minimal install of any linux system althoug testing with as many operating systems as possible would be much appreciated.

USAGE
=====

Just stick it in a directory you can reach, chmod it 700 and execute it.
It should preform some basic tests first, to see if anything is missing or missconfigured, and it should warn you if it finds something odd. Then executes.
You can set up a cron job to do it every hour or so for you, so you don't have to do it yourself.

Heve fun !
